## Project Overview

Master thesis on real-time reconstruction of envrionments in XR. Hydra was utilized to generate virtual representations of 3D environments. A data pipeline was implemented to reconstruct the 3D environment in Unity based on the virtual environment representation from Hydra, as a user experienced the environment being rendered in real-time in XR. The thesis can be found here.
