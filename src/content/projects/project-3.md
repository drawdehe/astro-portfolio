## Project Overview

Master thesis on real-time reconstruction of envrionments in XR. Hydra was utilized to generate virtual representations of 3D environments. A data pipeline was implemented to reconstruct the 3D environment in Unity based on the virtual environment representation from Hydra, as a user experienced the environment being rendered in real-time in XR. The thesis can be found [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9147083).
